# Simple Spotify Sub Playlist Maker
Requires user to input their playlist that they want to create a smaller sub playlist of. 
The user can choose the artists from the playlist that they want to filter by and also the name that they want for their new playlist. 
If name is the same as an existing playlist then the songs are added to the existing playlist instead.
